## Todo
- [ ] Add More Templates
  - [ ] LOGIN
    - The script allows the website's users to login to the website. 
  - [ ] SIGNUP
    - The script allows the website's users to signup to the website.
    - *No Sending Emails for Email Verification because that Will be a Pain to Implement.*
  - [ ] AUTH
    - This would be implemented along with Template Chaining. 
    - It would allow authentication, and then the running of another endpoint template. 
  - [ ] DELETE
    - Allows the user to delete a piece of data.
  - [ ] TEMP
    - Creates the skeleton of a request... this is for when the developer wants to do something but we don't have the template for them.
  - [ ] VERIFY_EMAIL
    - Allows the developer to implement email verification. This will make the authentication workflow much simplier.
